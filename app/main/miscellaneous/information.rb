            Hello! My name's Katie (she/they). I'm 19 and very queer.
            I've been making Discord bots for three years, and have grown as a person and a programmer since I began.
            I'm a fan of Splatoon, Kingdom Hearts, and Persona 5 and will happily go on about those for hours.
            My hobbies include programming, showering, supporting queer folks and throwing hands at homo/transphobes.
