## Other

- Due to the server-specific nature of this bot, it will not work on other servers unless you have the ability to 
understand my awful code enough to modify the bot for your own use, in which case feel free to clone the repo and run it
yourself!
- You can find me on Discord at `HECKSALMONIDS#0659` if you'd like to reach me about the bot for any reason.
